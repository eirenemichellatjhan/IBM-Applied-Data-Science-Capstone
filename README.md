This project analyzed SpaceX launch data to understand factors influencing mission outcomes and to predict future launch success. Initial exploration focused on payloads, launch sites, and orbit success rates using SQL and visualizations. Interactive dashboards and maps were created with Folium and Plotly Dash to better understand trends and locations of launches.

Predictive analysis was performed using classification models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN, with hyperparameter tuning to select the best-performing model. Results showed that Decision Tree and KNN achieved the highest test accuracy (88.89%), with the Decision Tree providing better class separation and fewer misclassifications. Analysis also revealed that SpaceX success rates improved significantly over time, especially after 2016.
